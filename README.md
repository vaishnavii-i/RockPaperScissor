Here's a detailed description of the Python code for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

1. The program starts by importing the `random` module, which is used to generate random choices for the computer player.

2. It then prints the rules of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in a multiline string format.

3. The main game loop is implemented using a `while True` loop, which continues until the user chooses to exit the game.

4. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter their choice (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors). The program validates the user's input to ensure it's within the valid range.

5. Based on the user's input, the program assigns a corresponding string value to the `choice_name` variable (e.g., 'Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors').

6. The program then generates a random number between 1 and 3 using the `random.randint()` function to represent the computer's choice. It assigns a corresponding string value to the `comp_choice_name` variable.

7. The program uses conditional statements to compare the user's choice and the computer's choice, and determine the winner based on the game rules.

8. The program then prints the choices made by the user and the computer, and displays the result of the game (either 'User wins', 'Computer wins', or 'It's a tie').

9. After the result is displayed, the user is asked if they want to play again. If the user enters 'n' or 'N', the game loop is exited.

10. Finally, the program prints a 'Thanks for playing!' message.

The key features of this program are:

- User input validation
- Random choice generation for the computer
- Implementation of the game logic using conditional statements
- Looping to allow for multiple rounds of the game
- Prompting the user to play again

This code demonstrates the use of Python's control flow statements (loops and conditionals), string manipulation, and integration of the `random` module to create a simple interactive game.
